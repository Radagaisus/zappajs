  - Changed: automatic input "importing" and "exporting" to templates now optional through the `databag` setting. See #84.

**v0.2.0beta** (2011-08-02):

  - Complete rewrite, see `/docs/peaches.md` for a more in-depth review on changes.
  
  - Fixed performance, now negligible overhead on top of express. Gone with the `with` keyword.

  - Scraped the `zappa` command, zappa code should go in `require('zappa') ->` blocks. All node tools and services can be used directly.

  - Changed `include`, now implemented through standard module mechanisms. Code to be included must be exported: `@include = ->`.

  - Added `app` and `io` variables to all scopes, providing direct access to express and socket.io.
  
  - Added optimized interfaces to express features such as `use`, `set`, `enable`, `disable`, `configure`, etc.
    
  - Changed `render`, now uses the rendering system from express, with all its features. Defining inline templates with `view` and passing variables through `@` is still possible.
    
  - Added an optional client-side API that can be used with `client`. To just serve code as JS, use `coffee`.
  
  - Added `shared`, allows sharing code between client and server.
  
  - Removed most zappa's defaults, added very concise APIs to define what you need.
